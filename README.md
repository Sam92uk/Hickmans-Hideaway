## Design

### Colour Scheme:
This colour palette was used with the thought of colours to match the seaside without feeling overwhelming. The main background & header colour is slate gray with federal blue text which mix well and do not overwhelm the user. The use of a subtle baby powder white was used when hovering over the nav links in the header and social links in the footer.

### Typography:
Courgette Cursive was used for the main logo and the headings on each of the pages as it is a stylish and decorative font that has visually appealing qualities. Josefin Sans Normal is used for all over text as it is simple and delicate along with being easy to read.

### Imagery:
All of the imagery on the website was sourced from free stock photo platforms. The hero image on the home page was chosen so the user new this was a relaxing and warm location to go for a meal by the seaside. Each additional image added was to support the overall theme of the site, and to remind the user that the restaurant is all about a relaxed and warm atmosphere with good food.
